      <h1>Kilotest</h1>
      <p>Kilotest can perform up to a thousand tests on a web page.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>A thousand? Really?</summary>
        <h2>Ensemble testing</h2>
        <p>Testing by realistic human users is valuable, but slow and expensive. You can optimize your investment in talented testers by discovering as many problems as possible with automated tests, and correcting those issues, <strong>before</strong> asking humans to start testing. Then testers will have less work to do and can concentrate on the subtle issues that automated tests did not detect.</p>
        <p>OK, but there are numerous automated testing tools. Which should you use? Kilotest is based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.07591">research</a> showing that each tool discovers only a fraction of the issues that multiple tools discover. Tools vary in what and how they test.</p>
        <p>The answer: <strong>ensemble testing</strong>. Test with several tools that have different strengths. Then assemble their results into a standardized report. That is what Kilotest does.</p>
        <h2>Kilotest services</h2>
        <p>Kilotest currently offers two services:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Kilotest Screen</strong> does quick preliminary testing of up to 5 web pages and gives you over-all <em>impact estimates</em>. This service can help if you want to compare the website qualities of various organizations.</li>
          <li><strong>Kilotest Dev</strong> runs all the tests of the whole ensemble, performing a thorough test of one web page, to identify as many issues as possible before human testing begins.</li>
        <h2>The tools</h2>
        <p>Kilotest leverages an ensemble of11 tools developed by teams around the world, including the USA, Canada, Denmark, Australia, and Portugal. Some of the tools are under active development, and when they get updated Kilotest users get the benefits.</p>
        <p>The tools perform more than a thousand tests in total. Specialized <a href="https://medium.com/cvs-health-tech-blog/how-to-run-a-thousand-accessibility-tests-63692ad120c3">open-source software</a> developed initially at CVS Health drives the tools and distills their results into about 300 <q>issues</q>.</p>
        <p>The tools in the ensemble are independent of each other and of Kilotest, so Kilotest cannot guarantee that every reported issue is a genuine problem. If you need that guarantee,Kilotest is not the right platform.</p>
        <h2>Status</h2>
        <p>Kilotest is an early-stage proof of concept, launched in November 2025. The currently used tools focus on HTML and CSS standards, usability, and accessibility. Your suggestions, bug reports, and collaboration proposals are welcome! Feel free to post them on <a href="https://github.com/jrpool/kilotest/issues">GitHub</a> or email them to <a href="mailto:info@kilotest.com">info@kilotest.com</a>.</p>
